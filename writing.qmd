From my work as a data scientist at the National Aviary, I authored of the statistical methods and results sections of the following papers, as well as created all of the figures:

[*Long-term monitoring reveals an avian species credit in secondary forest patches of Costa Rica*](https://peerj.com/articles/3539/#methods)
