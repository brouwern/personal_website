[**Learning the Math of Population Models**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Courses/Gettysburg_College/01%3A_Ecology_for_All/10%3A_Population_modeling/10.02%3A_Demographic_rates), *in* [Ecology for All!](https://bio.libretexts.org/Courses/Gettysburg_College/01%3A_Ecology_for_All)


## **Technical reports and academic papers**

From my work as a data scientist at the National Aviary, I authored of the statistical methods and results sections of the following papers, as well as created all of the figures:

[*Long-term monitoring reveals an avian species credit in secondary forest patches of Costa Rica*](https://peerj.com/articles/3539/#methods)

[*Avian community characteristics and demographics reveal how conservation value of regenerating tropical dry forest changes with forest age*](https://peerj.com/articles/5217/)
